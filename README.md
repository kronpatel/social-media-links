This is a CSS code for creating a social media icon menu with hover effects. The icons used are from the Font Awesome library, and the menu is positioned in the center of the page. The background color of the page is set to #ccc.

The ul element is positioned absolutely, and the top and left properties are set to 50%, which centers the menu horizontally and vertically. The transform property is used to move the menu up and left by 50% of its own width and height, respectively. The margin and padding properties of the ul element are set to 0.

The li elements are set to have no bullet points and a margin of 0px on the left and right of 40px. The .fa class has a font-size of 40px, a color of #262626, and a line-height of 80px. The transition property is set to 0.5s, which applies to all the child elements of the li element.

The a elements are displayed as blocks and have a width and height of 80px. The background-color of the a element is set to #fff. The text-align property is set to center, and the transform property applies perspective, rotation, skewing, and translation to the element. The transition property is also set to 0.5s, which applies to all the child elements of the a element. The box-shadow property is set to create a shadow effect.

The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to create the diagonal borders of the a element. The ::before element has a width of 20px, a height of 100%, and a background-color of #b1b1b1. The transform property is used to rotate the element and skew it. The ::after element has a width of 100% and a height of 20px, and the same transform and background-color properties as the ::before element.

When the a element is hovered over, it is transformed using the same transform property but with different values. The box-shadow property is also changed to create a larger shadow effect. When the li element is hovered over, the color of the .fa class is changed to #fff. When each li element is hovered over, the background-color, ::before, and ::after properties of the a element are changed to create a unique hover effect for each social media icon.
